# NaiveBayesClassifier - Using Python

The Naive Bayes algorithm is simple and effective and should be one of the first methods you try on a classification problem.

This is a spam classification example reading through the data.

Project Structure:

NaiveBayesClassifier directory has all the brain for training and also has the classifier which classifies a given message.
data directory has all the training and the test data

Running the code:

python spam_finder.py

This program executes and gives the metrics for the classifier.

This is a really dumb classifier and there are many ways of increasing its efficiency!
